// Exercise 8:
// For the final task you are given four variables:
// machineActive — contains an indicator of whether the login machine is switched on or 
// not (true/false).
// pwd — Contains the user's login password.
// machineResult — begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed 
// to the output panel, letting the user know whether the machine is switched on.
// pwdResult — begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to 
// the output panel, letting the user know whether their login attempt was successful.

// We'd like you to create an if...else structure that checks whether the machine is switched on and 
// puts a message into the machineResult variable telling the user whether it is on or off.

// If the machine is on, we also want a second conditional to run that checks whether the pwd is 
// equal to cheese. If so, it should assign a string to pwdResult telling the user they logged in 
// successfully. If not, it should assign a different string to pwdResult telling the user their 
// login attempt was not successful. We'd like you to do this in a single line, using something that 
// isn't an if...else structure.

    let machineActive = false;
    let pwd = 'cheese';

    let machineResult;
    let pwdResult;

    // Add your code here
    if (machineActive) {
        machineResult = 'The machine is switched on'

        //Placed the code here because you can only login if the machine is turned on.
        pwdResult = pwd === 'cheese' ? 'Logged in successfully!' : 'Login attempt was not successful...'
    } else {
        machineResult = 'The machine is turned off'
    }
