// Exercise 7:
// In this task you are provided with two variables:
// season — contains a string that says what the current season is.
// response — begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to 
// the output panel.
// We want you to create a conditional that checks whether season contains the string "summer", 
// and if so assigns a string to response that gives the user an appropriate message about the season.
//  If not, it should assign a generic string to response that tells the user we don't know what season it is.
// To finish off, you should then add another test that checks whether season contains the string 
// "winter", and again assigns an appropriate string to response.

    let season = 'winter';
    let response;

    // Add your code here

    if( season === 'summer') {
        response = 'Yes its summer.'
    } else if (season === 'winter') {
        response = 'Yes its winter.'
    } else {
        response = 'No, we dont know what the current season is.'
    }

    // Don't edit the code below here!

    const section = document.querySelector('section');

    let para1 = document.createElement('p');
    para1.textContent = response;
    section.appendChild(para1);
